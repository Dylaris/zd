# zst

## Brief

`zst.h` is a single-header C library for building C projects, inspired by the `tsoding/nobuild` project. 

The name "zst" stands for "zero start", meaning itâ€™s designed for environments without build tools like Makefile. It gives you the feeling of starting from scratch, where all you need is a good C compiler to build a C project.

To use `zst`, you should be comfortable with C and writing "C scripts" (similar to shell scripts, but with more type checks and memory management).

`zst` works on both Windows and Linux, offering a unified API for easier project portability.

## Features

- **`zst_forger`**: A build tool, named "forger".

- **`zst_flag`**: A command-line flag parser.

- **`zst_fs`**: File system operations.

- **`zst_ds`**: Data structures, including +=dynamic array=+, +=string=+, +=stack=+, and +=queue=+.

## Usage

```console
$ cd examples/hello
$ gcc -o build build.c -I ../..
$ ./build
$ ./hello
hello world
```
